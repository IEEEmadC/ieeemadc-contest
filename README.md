## Description

We think that not only technical and academic knowledge is important to individual development as a human being.
The culture and the environment in which we are inserted is crucial to make us better and change the world.
Due to that and with the power of the music and cultural acts, we want to create a mobile platform for musicians, artists,
teachers and the community to share their work through free events. These events could be from different categories
such as art, music, technology, food, sports and so on.
With that, locals could attend these events, enjoy local culture, acquire new skills and have awesome experiences.
All of that nicely presented in their own hands, in a intuitive and practical way.
